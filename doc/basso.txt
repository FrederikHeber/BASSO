***************************************
BASSO is a pass:[C++]-library solving over-determined or under-determined linear
systems of equations in general Banach spaces. Its interface mimics the same
concepts in terms of classes and functions that are also needed for the
mathematical proof of convergence, namely spaces, norms, vectors, and (duality)
mappings. In other words, vectors are uniquely associated to a specific space
instance and calculating a scalar product of vectors from different spaces will
fail. This allowed a very robust method of implementing the sequential subspace
optimization methods that can be considered a generalization of the the
Conjugate Gradient Minimal Error method from Hilbert spaces to Banach spaces.
Overall, this provides a very efficient library to solve linear systems of
equations with general l_p regularization. Moreover, it also allows to
calculate low-rank matrix factorizations.

BASSO received funding from the German Ministry for Research and Education
(BMBF) through the project HYPERMATH.

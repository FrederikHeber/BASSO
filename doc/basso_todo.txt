To Do
-----

- `GeneralMinimizer`'s takes the `InverseProblem` only out of convenience but it
is hard to understand why it needs it again in `operator()`. Cstor might get
away with just getting a space?
- `FeasibilityProblem::clear()` and `::finish()` can possibly be made protected
as user access is not needed.
- Remove the extra two space arguments in the cstor of `InverseProblem`. They
can be deduced from the Mapping.
- Split `Parameters` of `CommandLineOptions` to disassociate from
command-line context. The former only contains Serialization. Note that there
is already an `Options` class that does the storing.
- `Options` should have a convenience function `parse()` similar to `store()`, see
`Options::parse()` in "config" branch.

libBasso - BAnach Sequential Subspace Optimization library
==========================================================

Basso is a library to minimize a constrained functional in a Banach space
setting. It is an extension of the sequentional subspace optimization
method by Narkiss by multiple search directions.

Installation instructions:
--------------------------

Basso depends on the following packages:
 * cmake - make utility for checking prerequisites
 * Eigen - C++ library for linear algebra
 * CppUnit - C++ library for unit testing
 * levmar - implementation of the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm for 
   unconstrained minimization
 * boost - almost standard library (we require 1.54 due to logging)

... on Ubuntu
-------------
For Eigen and CppUnit packages exist but not so for levmar.

Levmar depends on two files: A header levmar.h and a library liblevmar.a.

Copy the former into a subfolder "include" of a common installation folder, e.g. levmar-2.6/include. Similarly, the library goes into a subfolder "lib".

It is advised to compile the source in a distinct build directory, e.g. in a subfolder "build64". This is referred to as out-of-source build. To prepare the compilation, call cmake then as follows:

cmake .. -DLEVMAR_INCLUDE_DIR=<path to installation folder>/levmar-2.6/include

If additionally boost libraries do not reside in standard folders, such as
/usr/include, /usr/lib ... but in ~/packages/boost the following options might help:

cmake -DBoost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS=ON -DBOOST_ROOT=~/packages/boost/

Note that boost libraries should have been compiled with "layout=tagged". Otherwise, FindBoost.cmake can not find the libraries and headers.

To allow for debugging, you might futher "add -DBoost_DEBUG=ON".

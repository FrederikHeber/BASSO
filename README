libBasso - BAnach Sequential Subspace Optimization library
==========================================================

Basso is a library to minimize a constrained functional in a Banach space
setting. It is an extension of the sequentional subspace optimization
method by Narkiss by multiple search directions.

Installation instructions:
--------------------------

Basso depends on the following packages:
 * cmake - make utility for checking prerequisites
 * Eigen - C++ library for linear algebra
 * CppUnit - C++ library for unit testing
 * levmar - implementation of the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm for 
   unconstrained minimization

... on Ubuntu
-------------
For Eigen and CppUnit packages exist but not so for levmar.

Levmar depends on two files: A header levmar.h and a library liblevmar.a.

Copy the former into a subfolder "include" of a common installation folder, e.g. levmar-2.6/include. Similarly, the library goes into a subfolder "lib".

It is advised to compile the source in a distinct build directory, e.g. in a subfolder "build64". This is referred to as out-of-source build. To prepare the compilation, call cmake then as follows:

cmake .. -DLEVMAR_INCLUDE_DIR=<path to installation folder>/levmar-2.6/include
